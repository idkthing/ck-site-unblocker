# Contentkeeper Site Unblocker
This is a portable application that allows you to essentially "unblock" nearly any URL. **Source code will be unavaliable for the forseeable future (most likely until the end of 2022) as to not allow the exploit to be patched.** This requires that your network has the "Contentkeeper Appliance" on it. I am unsure if this will work on every Contentkeeper system as I only designed it for the one I am used to. I have heard of different institutions installing the blocking software directly onto computers, so I am unsure if this program will work with those setups.
### Installing
Simply download the latest version from the releases tab and run it like a normal executable. Windows will probably think it's a virus due to the way it was compiled. I can assure you that it is not a virus, however you can decide whether you would trust me or not.
### Note
I am not responsible for any trouble I may get anyone into if they choose to use this tool, this is on you pal. Furthermore this tool is for educational use only, don't use it maliciously!!!
